                Beach

            <p> In my offtime I like to go to the beach either alone or with family and friends. I like the fresh salty air and weather, especially if it's a sunny day. But even if the sun is not out I can still catch some waves. <br>
                <br>
                I have surfed before but I like to boogie board and bodysurf. Also there is plenty of space to set up a bonfire/picnic and hangout with good food and a bunch of people. Not to mention playing games like frisbee or football. Overall I can always look forward to a day at the beach even i'm going alone.
                <br>
                <br>
                The main beaches I like to go to in San Diego are Coronado and La Jolla Shores. I haven't been to Carslbad or anything north of that. I like when the beach is clsoe to the city and the two are pretty much intertwined. Well known examples of this would be Miami and Santa Monica. Here in San Diego we have Mission Beach. I think the seamless transition between city and beach is cool.

            <p>
                I also like to go on hikes from time to time. If i'm already camping in the area that's a plus too because it makes it easier to hit multiple routes in larger areas, such as King's Canyon. That is the last larger area that I went to. But even locally there are many trails to climb the one in this picture here, Potato Chip Rock.

                I think that it is important to plan before ventures like this. You need to be prepared for the outdoors and understand that you give up certain luxuries to make the trek. With that said I think it's fun and enjoyable either alone or with company to explore. It also teaches you how to use limited resources to reach a certain goal.

            <h2 class="gym"> Gym</h2>

                I enjoy going to the gym as well. Lately, I've been using a home gym but I have routinely used commercial gyms in he past and look forward to continue doing so. 
                <br>
                <br>I think it is important to have a routine and goals set so that you have purpose when training, whether for a competition or personal goals. It is also nice to experience positive results by changing certain variables such as diet or exercises. But even if you were to reach maximum strength and performance, you still need to work to maintain it. Also, I feel good after a decent workout.     
                <br>
                <br>In this way I think an exercise regimen is similar to web development and software engineering. Programming is actually a popular term used for planning training and the specific exercises and volume to be done. Just like people can program the body for certain results, you can program something with a certain goal or function in mind, and work to maintain or even build it further.
